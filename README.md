# 🎬 Multifunctional application (shopping cart + film DB) - Node.js

A web application for managing and reviewing movies and actors. Also
for managing products inside a shopping cart. This project is part of my personal portfolio and a training ground for mastering backend development using Node.js and Express.

## 📌 Features

- User authentication (login/register/logout)
- Session-based login with "Remember Me" support
- Protected routes and session validation
- Product (movie) management (Add/Edit/Delete)
- Responsive UI with vanilla HTML/CSS
- JSON-based storage (temporarily replacing a real database)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 / CSS3
- `express-session` for session management
- bcrypt for password hashing
